# Skypoint (formerly Linkpoint/Lumiya Viewer)

Skypoint is an Android application for connecting to Second Life virtual worlds. This project contains the source code for the Lumiya viewer, a mobile client that allows users to access Second Life from their Android devices.

## Features

- **Virtual World Access**: Connect to Second Life virtual worlds
- **3D Rendering**: Advanced 3D graphics rendering for mobile devices
- **Asset Management**: Efficient handling of textures, animations, and geometry
- **Network Protocol**: Implementation of Second Life's communication protocols
- **Resource Caching**: Optimized caching system for improved performance

## Project Structure

The project follows standard Android application structure:

```

## Architecture

The application is structured with the following main components:

- **Resource Management**: Handles textures, animations, geometry, and other 3D assets
- **Network Layer**: Implements Second Life protocol communication (`SLCircuit`, `SLConnection`)
- **Rendering System**: 3D graphics rendering for terrain, objects, and avatars
- **Asset Pipeline**: Efficient loading and caching of virtual world resources

## Key Components

- `ResourceManager` - Central resource management system
- `SLAgentCircuit` - Main Second Life protocol handler  
- `AnimationCache`, `TextureCache`, `GeometryCache` - Asset caching systems
- `TerrainPatchGeometry` - Terrain rendering
- `DrawableText*` - Text rendering systems
